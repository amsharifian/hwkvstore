switchMode
    funct7 = 0
    rd = 0
    rs1 = 1 if write mode, 0 if read mode
    rs2 = 0
    xd = 0
    xs1 = 0
    xs2 = 0

    Note: You must switch to write mode before using any of the other
    instructions. You must switch the accelerator back to read mode if
    you want it to continue serving traffic.

delKey
    funct7 = 1
    rd = returns hash value or 0xffffff if not found
    rs1 = register containing address
    rs2 = register containing length
    xd = 1
    xs1 = 1
    xs2 = 1

reserveKey
    funct7 = 2
    rd = returns hash value or 0xffffff if no space available
    rs1 = register containing address
    rs2 = register containing length
    xd = 1
    xs1 = 1
    xs2 = 1

assocAddr
    funct7 = 3
    rd = 0
    rs1 = register containing hash value
    rs2 = register containing address (in accelerator SRAM)
    xd = 0
    xs1 = 1
    xs2 = 1

    Note: Use the hash value obtained from reserveKey.

assocLen
    funct7 = 4
    rd = 0
    rs1 = register containing hash value
    rs2 = register containing length
    xd = 0
    xs1 = 1
    xs2 = 1

writeVal
    funct7 = 5
    rd = 0
    rs1 = register containing hash value
    rs2 = register containing start address (in CPU mem)
    xd = 0
    xs1 = 1
    xs2 = 1

    Note: You must set up the address and length first using assocAddr
    and assocLen.
