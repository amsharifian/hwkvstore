\begin{block}{Conclusion}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
    \item By moving some of the keys to the accelerator and serving directly
        to the NIC from hardware, we gained an order of magnitude speed-up
        over memcached software running on the Rocket core.
    \item However, we still have a long way to go before reaching
        production quality.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Future Work}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
    \item Place the DMA engine, traffic manager, and accelerator in
	faster clock domains with asynchronous FIFOs, rather than be
	constrained by the core frequency
    \item Widen I/O interfaces for greater throughput
    \item Investigate replacing the fixed-function traffic manager with
        a programmable co-processor (reminiscent of mainframe channel I/O)
    \item Conduct torture testing for reliability
    \item Explore opportunities for measuring and improving energy efficiency
\end{itemize}
