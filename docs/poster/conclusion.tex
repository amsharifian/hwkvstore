\begin{block}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item By moving some of the keys to the accelerator and serving directly
        to the NIC from hardware, we gained an order of magnitude speedup
        over Memcached software running on the Rocket core.
    \item However, we still have a long way to go before we can match the
        speed of an Intel processor.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Currently, the traffic manager, DMA engine, and accelerator run at the
        same frequency as the Rocket core. However, we could place these
        components on faster clock domains and put asynchronous queues in
        between them.
    \item There are also functional optimizations that can be made to the
        packet filter and accelerator, like increasing the width of their
        input and output interfaces.
\end{itemize}
