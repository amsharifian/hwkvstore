\begin{block}{Motivation}
In Memcached in cluster mode, the software stack of the end host takes about
86-95 percent of the total latency. A large part of that latency comes from the
fact that we have to interrupt the CPU on every packet that it processes. Our
insight is that by servicing hot requests on an FPGA instead of in software, we
can substantially reduce the latency for most requests.
