\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize
\item Manages what keys and values are stored on the accelerator
\item Controls the accelerator through the RoCC co-processor interface, which
	provides custom instructions for setting keys and values
\item Responsible for implementing cache replacement policies
	\begin{itemize}
	\footnotesize
	\item Identification of the most popular keys as candidates for offloading
	\item Invalidation of stale entries
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%Another part of the software is when to push each key to the accelerator. For
%this, we approximated how memcached is used in cluster mode where every key is
%pushed to the cache. However, interrupting the accelerator to push every key is
%very expensive and most of the keys are part of the long tail of our input
%distribution. Thus, we probabilistically insert keys to the accelerator, so hot
%keys are likely to get in while keys in the tail aren't very likely to get
%pushed.
