\begin{block}{Software}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Software is responsible for managing what keys and values are
        stored on the accelerator.
    \item The software controls the accelerator through the RoCC co-processor
        interface, which provides custom instructions for setting keys and
        values.
    \item The software must handle cache invalidation and must determine
        what keys are most popular and therefore candidates for acceleration.
\end{itemize}

%Another part of the software is when to push each key to the accelerator. For
%this, we approximated how memcached is used in cluster mode where every key is
%pushed to the cache. However, interrupting the accelerator to push every key is
%very expensive and most of the keys are part of the long tail of our input
%distribution. Thus, we probabilistically insert keys to the accelerator, so hot
%keys are likely to get in while keys in the tail aren't very likely to get
%pushed.
