* Talk about the programming model here.

Another part of the software is when to push each key to the accelerator. For
this, we approximated how memcached is used in cluster mode where every key is
pushed to the cache. However, interrupting the accelerator to push every key is
very expensive and most of the keys are part of the long tail of our input
distribution. Thus, we probabilistically insert keys to the accelerator, so hot
keys are likely to get in while keys in the tail aren't very likely to get
pushed.
