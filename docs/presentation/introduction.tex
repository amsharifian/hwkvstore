\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In datacenter applications, path through CPU / kernel / application
        accounts for 86\% of total request latency
    \item \textbf{Goal}: Serve popular requests without CPU interruption
    \item \textbf{Solution}: Hardware key-value store attached to the network
        interface controller
    \item Many workloads have an access pattern suitable for a small dedicated cache
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Per a Facebook study, 10\% of keys represent 90\% of requests
            \item Most values are relatively small in size (\SI{1}{\kilo\byte})
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
