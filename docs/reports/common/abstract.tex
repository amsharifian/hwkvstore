    In-memory key-value stores are an important part of many datacenter
    applications. Web applications frequently use such software to cache the
    results of frequently recurring computations. Reducing the latency of
    key-value lookups will therefore go a long way towards improving total
    request latency. As a significant portion of the processing time for a
    request is due to the OS and application overhead, we believe bypassing the
    software layer and servicing these requests from a hardware accelerator
    will deliver significant benefits. In addition, previous studies have
    determined that the nature of key-value store workloads makes it feasible
    to implement such an accelerator as a small SRAM cache, instead of serving
    responses from DRAM as previous accelerators have done.  In this study, we
    implement a hardware accelerator for the Memcached key-value store on a
    Xilinx ZC706 development board and characterize its performance. Our
    initial evaluation with a realistic workload shows a 10x improvement in
    latency for 40\% of requests without adding significant overhead to the
    remaining requests.
