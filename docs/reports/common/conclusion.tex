\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we described a hardware accelerator for the Memcached key-value
store which we developed and evaluated on the ZC706 FPGA development board.
By storing keys and values in a dedicated SRAM cache and serving responses
directly to the NIC without involving the CPU, our accelerator delivers an
order of magnitude improvement in latency. We furthermore showed that our
accelerator can store a number of key-value pairs sufficient to serve 40\% of
the requests in a real-world workload.
