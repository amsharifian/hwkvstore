\subsection{Pre-existing Components}
    Our system is built on a Xilinx ZC706 FPGA Evaluation platform. This board
    contains a Xilinx Zynq-7000 XC7Z045-2FFG900C AP SoC, with two ARM Cortex-A9
    MPCore application processors attached to programmable logic. Our full-system
    design runs on the programmable logic, with the ARM cores used only for 
    bootstrapping and non-network I/O purposes. In order to create an ethernet interface accessible
    to the programmable logic, we take advantage of the ZC706's SFP cage with a 
    Brocade \SI{1}{\giga\bit} Copper SFP Transceiver.

\label{fig:rocketpipe}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


    As our application processor, we use the open-source 64-bit RISC-V Rocket Core.
    The Rocket core is a
    6-stage, single-issue, in-order pipeline running at \SI{50}{\mega\hertz} on the FPGA fabric. The
    Rocket pipeline is elaborated in Figure \ref{fig:rocketpipe}. This 
    core is supported by Rocket-Chip, which contains uncore components such as
    caches and coherence agents, along with the host-machine interface (HTIF) \cite{rocket}.
    On our ZC706 board, Rocket has \SI{512}{\mebi\byte} of DRAM, a \SI{16}{\kibi\byte} instruction cache, and a
    \SI{32}{\kibi\byte} data cache, while the HTIF bus supports block devices, a console, and
    externally initiated DMA transfers into DRAM.

\subsection{Custom Components}
    For our base system, we used the standard, publicly-available 
    distribution of the RISC-V Rocket Core for Xilinx Zynq FPGAs. As of the 
    start of our project, this distribution contained only a Rocket Core on
    the FPGA fabric, without I/O peripherals. As a result, during our bringup phase 
    we built many components from scratch that other projects take for granted. We hope that
    the presence of these components on the open-source RISC-V platform
    will accelerate future research efforts. The following sections describe our
    experiences bringing up various hardware and software components that support
    our accelerator.

\subsubsection {SFP Bring-up}
    In order to give the programmable logic access to a network, we use 
    the small form-factor pluggable (SFP) cage on the ZC706 board to house a 
    one gigabit SFP transceiver. Although the ZC706 contains an existing Ethernet
    PHY, it is tied to the ARM cores on the Zynq-7000 SoC, and attaching it to 
    the programmable logic is not feasible without introducing significant 
    latency overheads.

    The SFP requires a low-jitter \SI{125}{\mega\hertz} clock for operation. This is provided
    by an on-board Si5324 jitter attenuator chip. This chip does not default to 
    \SI{125}{\mega\hertz} and instead must be programmed over I\textsuperscript{2}C \cite{xapp1082}. Since the I\textsuperscript{2}C bus is exposed
    only to the ARM cores on the Zynq SoC, bringup for this clock is the 
    responsibilty of a Linux driver running on the ARM core.

\subsubsection{Building the Network Interface Card}

\begin{figure}[t]

\label{fig:nic}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

    Our system uses Xilinx IP included in Vivado $2014.2$ in order to construct 
    a 1Gbps Network Interface Card. The first of these components is the LogiCORE
    IP Ethernet 1000Base-X PCS/PMA or SGMII core \cite{pcspma}. The PCS/PMA
    core implements the 1000Base-X Physical Coding Sublayer and Physical Medium
    Attachment standards, as described in IEEE 802.3-2008. The core integrates
    a device specific transceiver that is compatible with our Brocade SFP Module.
    On the client side, the PCS/PMA core provides an MDIO interface for control
    and a GMII interface for data.

    The second component of the NIC is the Xilinx LogiCORE IP Tri-Mode Ethernet 
    MAC \cite{trimac}. The MAC implements the Ethernet Medium Access Controller
    protocol as defined in the IEEE 802.3-2008 specification. The MAC handles
    ethernet framing protocols and error detection. It attaches to the PCS/PMA
    IP through a GMII interface for data and an MDIO interface for control.
    On the CPU-side, the core exposes AXI4-Stream interfaces for transmit and 
    receive and an AXI4-Lite Interface for management \cite{axi}. Both of these
    interfaces attach to custom hardware interfaces added to the Rocket core.


\subsection{Bootstrapping the System}
    \subsubsection{ARM Core}

    When power is first supplied to the board, our full-system design, containing
    Rocket along with the traffic manager, accelerator, DMA engine, and NIC is 
    pushed onto the programmable logic in the Zynq SoC. Next, a copy of Linux
    with support for SFP clock bringup is booted on the ARM cores in the Zynq
    SoC. The \texttt{fesvr-zynq} application then executes on the ARM core. 
    This program copies a specified RISC-V binary into the Rocket Core's DRAM 
    over the HTIF bus and resets the Rocket Core. In our case, we supply a 
    \texttt{vmlinux} binary containing the RISC-V Linux kernel, along with a 
    root filesystem.

    \subsubsection{Rocket Core}

    From this point forward, the Rocket Core executes independently of the ARM 
    core. The ARM core now handles only non-network I/O for the Rocket core over
    the HTIF bus. Upon boot, the Rocket core uses our custom TEMAC driver to 
    bring up the NIC, using custom control registers for configuration of the
    NIC and DMA engine.


\subsection{Future Infrastructure Work}
    Although not relevant to system correctness, we do not adhere to the RISC-V
    vision for I/O as defined in the upcoming privileged 
    specification. For reference, the resource utilization of our full system 
    is noted in Figure \ref{fig:utiltab}.
