Others have advocated and explored reducing the latency of datacenter 
applications, including memcached, by modifying the software stack 
\cite{rumbleHotos}, \cite{memcachefacebook}. However, 
our scheme aims to remove the software altogether in the common case. 

Additionally, prior work has been done on accelerating memcached using
hardware, however these approaches either limit the functionality of memcached
by attempting to implement all memcached features in hardware \cite{memcachedappliance} 
or they require expensive accesses to DRAM for every key that the accelerator 
serves, increasing latency \cite{memcachedDRAMaccel}. We aim to design a system that minimizes latency for 
a small number of popular keys, while handling the remaining keys in software.
In essence, an external observer cannot tell the difference between our 
accelerated FPGA-based memcached nodes and memcached running on standard 
server-class hardware, except that some values are returned at extremely low latencies.
