Others have advocated and explored reducing the latency of datacenter
applications, including memcached, by modifying the software
stack~\cite{rumbleHotos, memcachefacebook}. However, our scheme aims to remove
the software altogether in the common case. 

Additionally, previous efforts have accelerated memcached using hardware.
However, these approaches either limit the functionality of memcached by
attempting to implement all memcached features in
hardware~\cite{memcachedappliance} or require expensive accesses to DRAM for
each key that the accelerator serves, increasing
latency~\cite{memcachedDRAMaccel}.  We aim to design a system that minimizes
latency for a small number of popular keys, while handling the remaining keys
in software. Aside from some values being returned at extremly low latencies,
an external observer should not be able to distinguish our accelerated
FPGA-based memcached nodes from memcached running on standard server-class
hardware.
