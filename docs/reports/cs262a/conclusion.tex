\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we design a hardware accelerator for the Memcached key-value
store and evaluate it on the ZC706 FPGA development board. By storing keys and
values in a dedicated SRAM cache and serving responses directly to the NIC 
without involving the CPU, our accelerator delivers an order of magnitude
improvement in latency. We furthermore show that our accelerator can store
enough key-value pairs to serve 40\% of requests in a real-world workload.
